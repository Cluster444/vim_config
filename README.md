# Getting Started

Before installing you will likely want to backup your current .vimrc file and .vim
directory if you have one. It would also be a good idea to fork and clone from your
own account rather than cloning this so you may customize as you see fit.

# Installation

## Clone the repo locally

    cd ~
    # Remember to replace with path to your repo
    git clone git@github.com:Cluster444/vim_config .vim

## Create symlinks

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
